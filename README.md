# Synthesizer
Program creates sine waves (see SineWave class) which can have their amplitudes adjusted (see VolumeAdjuster class) and mixed together (see Mixer class).

Program also has an interactive GUI built with JavaFX that allows users to generate, manipulate, and mix custom frequencies or set notes.
